Linux on the ECO32 architecture
=================================

This is a port of Linux to ECO32 (eco32) processor.

In order to compile for ECO32, you need a version of GCC and Binutils with
support to produce code for the eco32 architecture which is not upstream
in the gcc itself.

What is ECO32?
================
The ECO32 project was inspired by Jan Gray's three-part article
"Building a RISC System in an FPGA" which appeared in the March
through May 2000 issues of "Circuit Cellar - The Magazine for
Computer Applications". We are building a similar system with
a lot of enhancements.

ECO32 is a simple, fast 32-bit processor that runs C code, currently
without floating point operations. We want to execute some flavour
of UNIX on it, so it has got two operating modes (kernel/user) and
a memory management unit (paging with TLB support). The processor
was first simulated at the instruction set level, then at the HDL
level, and has finally been implemented in an FPGA.
