                            BOOTING ECO32 LINUX
                            ===================


In order to boot linux on eco32 one needs a bootloader to load the kernel from
persistant memory to RAM.

Linux on eco32 probes itself witht the device tree in all cases. So one way or
the other a device tree needs to be present when booting linux. This can be done
on two ways. Either passed by the bootloader or as builtin device tree.


The bootloader can optionally pass arguments to the kernel which will determin
its behavior at runtime. If arguments are mandatory or not depends on the kernels
configuration.


If ther kernel accepts arguments passed by the bootloader is determined thorugh
Kconfig option CONFIG_ARGUMENT_PASSING. Each subset of arguments have thier own
config option available.


Kernel Command Line:
- optional
- register 4
- CONFIG_ARGUMENT_CMDLINE
If enabled the kernel expects a kernel command line beeing passed in register 4.
If the kernel is configured to accept a command line from the bootloader it will
copy it to the internal command line or ignores it if register 4 is loaded with
0.

Device Tree:
- mandatory if no builtin device tree, optional otherwise
- register 5
- CONFIG_ARGUMENT_DEVICETREE
If enabled the kernel expects a device tree beeing passed in register 5.
This option is mandatory if no device tree is bultin in the kernel.
If register 5 is loaded with 0 the argument will be ignored.
If a bultin device tree is present but also a device tree is passed by the
bootloader the one passed by the bootloader will be favored.
If the builtin device tree should be used in all cases this option should be
disabled and a builtin device tree will be used if present.

Initrd:
- optional
-register 6 and 7
- CONFIG_ARGUMENT_INITRD
If enabled the kernel expects the initrd to be passed by the bootloader in register
6 and 7. Register 6 needs to contain the start of the initrd and register 7 the end
of the initrd in memory. If one register is loaded with 0 the arguments will be
ignored. If the kernel is configured to accept the initrd to be passed by the
bootloader and also has a bultin initrd present the one passed by the bootloader
will be favored.
