## ECO32 Linux Port
This is the official Linux port for the ECO32.
It was ported as a part of my currently ongoing bachelor degree and to this date
is functional and can be compiled and run inside the available simulator.

If you have any questions (or are eager to contribute to this
project), don't hesitate to contact me by email to

or join #eco32-linux on irc.quakenet.org

#### Compile and run Linux on ECO32
If you are interested in compiling and run this port consider to use the automated
Cross-Linux-From-Scratch provided on my github. Everything you need to know on how to build
and run is explained there.

## ECO32
ECO32 is a simple, fast 32-bit processor that runs C code, currently
without floating point operations. We want to execute some flavour
of UNIX on it, so it has got two operating modes (kernel/user) and
a memory management unit (paging with TLB support). The processor
was first simulated at the instruction set level, then at the HDL
level, and has finally been implemented in an FPGA.
